Healthcare Educational AI 

A CLI tool that uses ChatGPT to teach you about the heart, a muscular organ that pumps blood to various parts of the body. 

HEART stands for "Heat Electric Amplificiation Resonative Tubes". The architecture and design of the tool are based on tubesciraszca which conducts electric signals to various parts (modules) of the software system to enlighten beings about the inner workings of the human body, mind, and energy system through computers. 

Surprise, MFs!
